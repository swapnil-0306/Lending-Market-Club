Lending Market Club is a market place for personal loan & matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investor looking to lend money & make a return.

Each borrower fills out a application form by providing past financial details, reason of the loan etc.

Lending club evalutes each borrower’s credit score using the historical data and then assigns the interest rate to the borrower.

Approved loans are then listed on the lenders club website where investors can browse on recent approved loans, the borrowers credit score the purpose for the loan and information related to their personal status.

Once an investor decides to fund a particular loan, then the borrower makes monthly payment back to the lending club. Lending club then re-distrubutes these payments to the investors. This means that the investor don’t have to wait until the full amount is paid off to see their returns.

If a loan is paid fully paid off on time then the investor makes a return which correspond to the intrest rate the borrower had ti pay in addition to the requested amount.

Many users don’t pay their loan on time, here we will be making a model using machine learning to help the lending club understand whether the user will be able to pay or not on using the historical data.
